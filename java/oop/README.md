## When to use methods in Java?

Java can be used in different ways. You can either use a method or send your data into Java Streams or a simple [loop](../loop/).

Benefits of using methods:

* Methods calls are cheap and don't add processing overhead
* Methods reduce the line of code per logical section
* Methods are easier to find (in the code by name, method calls etc.)
* Methods are reusable
